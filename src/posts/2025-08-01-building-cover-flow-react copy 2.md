excerpt: How to implement a 3D cover flow effect with React and MUI.
---

This post walks through creating a looping 3D cover flow with React and Material UI. We use transforms like `translateZ` and `rotateY` with a simple modulo index to keep the carousel infinite.

Key ideas:

- Maintain a `currentIndex` and compute signed offsets for each slide.
- Use CSS perspective and `transform-style: preserve-3d` for depth.
- Add keyboard support for ArrowLeft/ArrowRight.

Happy hacking!
